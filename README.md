# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this report is to use unsupervised machine learning to determine which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system to develop a cryptocurrency investment portfolio.

The dataset for this project is sourced from [CyptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist) and contains data about the number of coins mined, the coin supply, the algorithm, the proof type, and the name of the coin. This raw data is not ideal and needed to be processed before it could be entered in the machine learning model. A clustering algorithm was used to group the cryptocurrencies and data visualizations were used to show the results.
